## Hey!

My name is Johannes, and I'm a 2nd year honours CS student at the University of Waterloo. I love to consistently gain knowledge, develop stuff that actually have a real-world impact, and learn from other engineers. I'm always open to collab and work on cool stuff, so hit me up if you have anything in mind!
